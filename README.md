Instructions for use:

Script defines a wait time - can reset this to longer/shorter - upon running script, open EVE client screen and wait for a screenshot to be taken/appear. Simply draw a bounding box over the local window pilot list (do not exceed the rectangle that bounds the character/pilot list), and press x. The app will then be active, and a warning sound will emit each time a pilot enters or leaves system.

Future updates will include: CLI interface to whitelist/blacklist pilots through the use of OCR, options for warning sounds, potentially options for separate warnings for whitelisted/blacklisted characters.
